// The MHGU material: MeshStandardMaterial plus the onBeforeCompile pigment / matcap shader,
// driven by what the game's own material file (.mrl) says about each material, resolved
// through the shader package into docs/materials.json (Phase 3, 2026-09-03). The shader
// text, the uniform block and the pigment math are what the single script carried, kept
// verbatim; index.html writes `tint` and calls applyTint on armorMats when a pigment changes.
//
// What the ROM decides here, per material (spec.rom, from materials-db.js specFor):
//   blend state  BSSolid opaque; BSBlendAlpha transparent, no depth write, drawn after the
//                opaque parts; BSAddAlpha additive and unlit (the glow parts); BSRevSubAlpha
//                the same but reverse-subtracted, so it DARKENS instead (monsters only:
//                Khezu's blood, Old Fatalis' face_sub, Grimclaw Tigrex's angry_arm)
//   cull         RSMesh back -> front faces only; RSMeshCN -> both; RSMeshCF -> back faces
//   depth bias   RSMeshBiasN (-32 N) -> a constant polygon offset of that many depth units
//                toward the camera, no slope term (decal layers such as the Charge Blade 064
//                shield face and the Lecturer's Footwear cuff band). A slope-scaled offset
//                pushed the cuff band through the boot shell at grazing angles (Raven,
//                2026-09-03: "a little bit of the black material ... peek out"); the constant
//                offset at the ROM's value shows none.
//   alpha        the alpha TEST is bit 20 of the material's feature word (with FTransparency
//                Alpha): discard texels at or below fAlphaClipThreshold, 0.0 on every material
//                seen, so only the exact-zero holes go. The Alpha feature without that bit
//                (Nerscylla's mail, 2,819 materials) only feeds alpha to a blend state -- the
//                game draws them whole. AlphaConstant -> the constant transparency
//   albedo tint  fAlbedoColor x fDiffuseColor multiplies the map (greys 0.8..0.95 on some)
//   emission     fEmissionColor, as self-illumination proportional to the map
//   sphere map   FReflect SphereMap -> the tSphereMap binding, scaled by fReflectiveColor
//                (0 switches it off on 31 materials that carry the feature) and the gloss:
//                the map's alpha when tSpecularMap is the albedo, else the separate specular
//                map's luminance (a greyscale mask, alpha 1.0). GlobalCubeMap is the stage's
//                reflection, which the viewer has no stand-in for: no term
//   Fresnel      Schlick with fFresnelSchlickRGB as F0 (1.0 on 246 of 264 globals: no change)
//   pigment      flag 0x20 marks the dyeable region (the `_sym_` materials, 99% of them);
//                flag 0x40 without 0x20 is the colour-override class (skin, fur, face)
// Approximations kept from before: the studio lights, roughness .85 (lowered only where
// fShininess exceeds 16), the screen-blended matcap at envAmount.

// Both branches build a MeshBasicMaterial and returned before the lit path's colour work, so three
// ROM terms never reached them. They are applied here so the two branches cannot drift apart again;
// they already did once, which is how every additive material lost its depth bias.
//
//   1. THE ALBEDO TINT, fAlbedoColor x fDiffuseColor. The lit path (the `mat.color.setRGB` below)
//      and the unlit path both apply it; add/revsub did not. 24 monster materials and 588 armour
//      and weapon materials carry a non-unit tint here and were drawn untinted.
//
//   2. fConstantColor, where the feature word asks for it. `feat.albedo === 'MapConstant'` means
//      the albedo is the map MULTIPLIED BY fConstantColor, and that constant's base value is
//      glob.constant -- the same float4 the material animation's fConstantColor track writes
//      (monster.js applyTrack). Of the 78 add/revsub monster materials, 31 are MapConstant: four
//      carry a tinted constant (0.4/0.4/0.4, 0.4/0.86/1.0, 0.08/0.32/0.32, 0.32/0.08/0.08) and
//      **three carry alpha 0.0**, meaning INVISIBLE AT REST -- exactly what the ROM intends, since
//      their Angry_Start / Gekikou_Start clips ramp that alpha to 1. Savage Deviljho's
//      XfB__m02_body_k is one of the three: drawn at full strength it is a permanent glow instead
//      of one the rage lights up.
//
//   3. THE ALPHA TEST, for feat.transp === 'Alpha' with the material's alphaTest bit. 41 monster
//      and 642 armour/weapon add/revsub materials have it and were drawing their cut texels.
//
// NOT applied here, and deliberately: fEmissionColor. 71 monster add/revsub materials carry one,

// 1,177 of them auto-play) carry an animation block in their .mrl and were drawn frozen at frame 0.
// material.js's own notes already deferred to this -- the Charge Blade phial box "adds nothing until
// its material animation lights it", and the Sword & Shield 134 mapless overlay likewise.

// two apps genuinely differ. The ROM's own default policy is the auto-play bit (clip+0x04 bit 1),
// which is what an armour viewer wants; the monster app layers its enraged/calm state on top.
//
// THE FRAME RATE. The evaluator's clock is `slotTime += material[+0x20] * dt`
//     00b0cf24 vldr s18,[r3] / 00b0cf28 vldr s0,[sb,#0x20] / 00b0cf2c vldr s2,[sp,#0x10]

// so slotTime carries the SAME UNIT as `frames`. uBaseModel 0x88c494 passes dt through unmodified
// (`0088c4c0 vldr s16,[r4,#0x1c]`, cUnit::mDeltaTime), so material animation and MOTION share one
// tick. All of that is decoded and holds.
//
// WHAT IS NOT DECODED IS THE WALL-CLOCK RATE, and this constant is an ASSUMPTION, not a reading.
// Corrected 2026-09-10 after Raven: "The game runs at ~30 FPS, so the effect looks fast compared to
// what we see in game." The two arguments that used to sit here for 60 do not survive:
//
//   * "8,848 of 14,538 durations are an integral frame count at 60 and not at 30" does not
//     discriminate. Any integer frame count is a whole number of frames at either rate; the test
//     only ever measured how round the resulting SECONDS looked, which is a matter of taste.
//   * The exported motion keyframes sit 0.01667 s apart, i.e. 59.99 fps, over 283,323 keys. That is
//     `lmt_to_gltf`'s own choice when it turned LMT frame indices into glTF seconds -- a
//     third-party tool's assumption, not the ROM's statement. Citing it as confirmation was
//     circular, and it was mine.
//
// The one structural argument that does hold points at 30. material[+0x20] multiplies dt, so it is
// a RATE MULTIPLIER, and a rate multiplier's neutral value is 1.0. For the sum to reach `frames`
// with a 1.0 multiplier, dt must be in FRAME UNITS -- about 1.0 per tick, not ~0.0167 seconds. Then
// a clip's duration is its frame count in GAME TICKS, and the wall-clock length is frames divided
// by the rate the game actually ticks at. MHGU ticks at ~30. Akantor's 96-frame Angry loop is then
// 3.2 s in game, and this viewer was playing it in 1.6 s -- exactly the doubling Raven reports.
//
// This also means the content may well be authored at 60, as Raven guessed ("it wouldn't shock me
// to find out everything is calculated around 60fps, but looks different due to the 3DS
// framerates") -- and it still plays at 30 ticks per second, because dt is counted in ticks.
//
// STILL UNREAD, and it is the thing that would settle this outright: material[+0x20] itself.
// Searched again 2026-09-10 and it is not written anywhere in the material-animation module
// (0xb08000..0xb12000 holds no `vstr` to [reg,#0x20]), and it does not come from the .mrl -- the
// material record is 60 bytes and words 8..12 and 14, the only ones nothing reads, are ZERO on all
// 577 monster materials across 187 files. So it is set by code that has not been found. Until it
// is, this number rests on Raven's eyes rather than on the ROM, and it is labelled that way.
//
// REVERTED TO 60 the same day, because changing it globally REGRESSED A MONSTER Raven had already
// signed off. He set 30 from Akantor's rage effect looking fast against the game; within the hour:
// "Grimclaw albedo looks wrong agian", and "Tigrex still looks fine somehow". A diff of every
// change since Grimclaw last looked right came back with exactly two, one of them an em033_00-only
// parts entry that cannot reach Grimclaw -- so this constant was the cause, with nothing else in
// the running. Tigrex survived it because he has ONE animated material; Grimclaw has four, and one
// of them cycles fEmissionColor from (0.75, 0.25, 0.25) to (1, 0, 0) on a 90-frame loop, so halving
// the rate is plainly visible on him and nearly invisible on Tigrex.
//
// THE LESSON, and it is the reason this note is long. A single global constant is the wrong
// instrument for a question the ROM has not answered. It silently re-times all 425 monster clips to
// buy one monster's effect, and the cost lands on monsters already judged -- Raven, seeing it:
// "this is the exact situation I wanted to avoid". The rate stays at the value everything was
// judged against until material[+0x20] is actually read, and anything wanting a different speed
// should be a control Raven can turn, not a constant swapped underneath him.
//
// So 60 here is NOT a claim that 60 is the ROM's rate. It is the value the library was reviewed at.
// The argument above for 30 still stands on its own terms and is deliberately left in place.

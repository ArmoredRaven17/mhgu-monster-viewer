// WHEN A MONSTER'S EFFECTS RUN: the requests its own code makes, per the viewer's state.
//
// Each effect in docs/effects/<monster>.json carries `when` (C:\MHGU-Extract\efx\export_effects.py), the
// state in which the monster's code starts it (E:\offline\decode\notes\effects-firing.md):
//   'always'     from the moment the monster is shown
//   'calm'       while NOT enraged -- the inverse of 'rage' (Nakarkos's charge aura, em084_00_060 on joint 0:
//                his code steps it through hadouhou charge stages 1..3 driven by charging actions, gated OFF
//                of the enrage/red state; the viewer ties it to Raven's Calm+Charging rungs, i.e. !rage)
//   'rage'       while enraged (Savage Deviljho's aura and eyes, em043_05_000 keys 30 / 31; Teostra's fire
//                aura, em027_00_011 key 0 -- Teostra's own switch for it is a byte its hook sets and clears,
//                0xe107ac, which the viewer ties to Enraged on Raven's word: "does not turn off with Enraged")
//   'rageStart'  once, as rage turns on (Teostra's burst, em027_00_019 key 2)
//   'rageEnd'    once, as rage turns off (em027_00_019 key 3; Teostra's aura end, em027_00_018 key 1)
//   'event'      when the game event its monster's code requests it on happens -- a part break (Savage's u 1000 / 1001 /
//                900, breaks-em043.md), an ailment (c 1100..1109, states-em043.md 3.4); render/motion-states.js says
//                when (fire)
//   'ragePuff'   a one-shot the shared rage puff requests on its countdown while enraged (Rathian's u 1120 / 1121,
//                states-em001.md 2.3): render/motion-states.js RAGE_PUFF names them and picks which, setRagePuff /
//                stepPuff below count
// An entry without `when` is a 'rage' effect, as the viewer showed every effect before it had the field.
//
// LEAVING THE STATE. An entry with `stop: 'request'` is ended the way its monster's code ends it -- Teostra's
// aura goes out through a stop request (0x329c40(core, 0) at 0xe1108c) and fades over its own frames; the
// core it kept is forgotten there, so the next rage starts a new aura beside the fading one (0xe111d8 has
// nothing to kill). Savage's aura and eyes end the same way: its rage controller (0xe80500, variant 5 only)
// stops both handles with 0x329c40(h, 0) at 0xe805e8 / 0xe8060c when rage ends. Any other 'rage' effect comes
// off at once, which is only right where its monster's code is read to kill it.
//
// A request that has run its course (proof.js finished()) is dropped, and units the passes no longer act
// on come off the list (pruneUnits). Every start builds the request anew -- the heap is a bump allocator, so
// each costs its objects for good; a start allocates once, its frames do not.
//
// The same class runs in the viewer (live.js) and headless (dev/effect-export-rom.mjs), so what the pages
// export and the soak exercise is what the viewer does.
//
// AN ATTACK CLIP'S EFFECTS (`when: 'clip'`) are started and told when to end the way the game's PSL walker does it
// (cMhEffectSequence: update 0x31ca58, frames 0x31cd70). render/monster.js CLIP_EFFECTS holds each motion's
// schedule as the PSL defines it: the slot's frame count and, per bit, the record it fires and the frames it is on.
// index.html hands the playing clip over every frame (setClip); the walk runs once per step, before the unit passes,
// as the walker runs in the monster's update ahead of the effects':
//   * every bit's state word loses its notices (& 0xfff0, 0x31ca7c);
//   * a NEW motion ORs 4 (mNoticeMotionChange) into every word, forgets which bits were on and processes no frame --
//     the frame it starts from is where the next update begins (0x31cb40, 0x31cbe0);
//   * a frame that went BACKWARDS (a loop) ORs 8 (mNoticeFrameBackword) into every word, then processes from the old
//     frame to the slot's end and on from the loop start (0x31cbac, 0x31ccdc);
//   * otherwise the frames crossed since the last update, ceil(prev) .. ceil(cur)-1, at most 32 (0x31cd7c).
// Per processed frame and bit: off->on starts the bit's record (0x31c980 -> the enemy's 0x6ff6c: the SEQUENCE record
// with that effectNo, in c.pel for p1 3 and u.pel for p1 4) and points the new effect's core at the bit's state
// word (core +0x194, 0x31ca14); on->on ORs 1 (0x31ca2c); on->off ORs 2 (0x31ca40, mNoticeSequenceBitOff). Every
// rise starts a new effect, whatever is still running from the last one -- the game does, and a slot that names
// the same record on two bits (Khezu's Motion 3: key 201 on bits 6 and 9) starts it twice.
//   What an effect does with those notices is its own code, lifted: the core's update (0x43168 -> 0x328ea8 ->
// the running state 0x3295fc) reads the word, and the record's END MODE (core +0xca, the pel record's byte +0x3a)
// decides -- modes 1 and 2 stop on bit-off or a motion change, mode 0 ignores bit-off and stops on a motion change,
// a loop or its own end. A stopped effect is NOT taken away: the stop (0x329874, whatever the reason) ends its
// emitters (0x327e7c: gracefully for the record's +0x3b 0, at once for 1) and the core waits in state 2 while it
// runs out, drawn, until its last effect is gone (0x426e0; the ROM's own limit there is 1800 frames). Only then
// is the request finished() and dropped.

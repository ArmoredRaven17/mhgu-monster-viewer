// LIVE EFFECTS: a monster's effects running on the ROM-translated runtime, drawn by three.js.
//
// docs/effects/<monster>.json names the effect files and the joints their nodes bind to
// (C:\MHGU-Extract\efx\export_effects.py). For each, the host (host.js) loads the list with the game's
// loader; every effect hangs from one PARENT UNIT whose joint matrices are the monster's bones, and is
// started the way the monster's request starts it (proof.js) in the state its `when` names (schedule.js:
// always, while enraged, or once as rage turns on or off) -- and every 1/60 s -- the rate the .efl header
// declares, and the step the emulator harness verified -- moves it.
// Every rendered frame draws it: the effect draw and the engine's primitive draw run on the host, and
// each primitive GPU draw they produce becomes a mesh here, with the ROM's own vertices, index strips,
// shader program (primshader.js), constant buffers, textures and blend / depth / rasterizer state.
//
// MODEL PARTICLES are drawn with the effect model's own material program (TMaterialStd, translated the
// same way: modelshader.js, whose header lists what the viewer supplies that the ROM's build did) under
// the engine's model draw (modeldraw.js: world matrix, CBMaterial, fPrimColor, global transparency,
// blend by the generator's mode, depth by its flags).
//
// UNITS: the viewer's world is game units / 100 (build-hitzones.py), and a monster's skeleton is posed in
// viewer units: a bone's world matrix with its translation scaled by 100 is the joint's matrix in the
// game's space, and the shaders' view-projection carries that 0.01 back.
//
// WHAT THE RENDERER SUPPLIES, as the game's does around the effect draw:
//   * the view's constant buffers (CBViewProjection, CBScreen) from this render's camera -- in the game the
//     renderer fills them per view; the draws the host records carry the harness's camera block, whose
//     view-projection is empty, so those two buffers are never taken from a draw (cameraMatrices below)
//   * the scene depth both programs' soft edges read (sceneDepth below)
//   * textures sampled as stored: the effect textures are MT format 7, NVN RGBA8 UNORM (0xb07e48), no decode
//   * a GROUND to draw against (groundPlane below): the game's effects meet its terrain, the viewer has none
//   * the colour written as the programs return it (primshader.js, OUTPUT: RGBA8 UNORM targets)
// Interfaces the draws never select (FFogVTF, FAlphaTest, ...) run their own bodies (no fog, no alpha test).
